     * Attempts to get a named lock for a period of $timeout seconds and retry $maxAttempts times during this time,
     * according to a back-off strategy.
     *
     * The most reliable way to get a lock is to leave $maxAttempts at its default value and vary only the $timeout.
     *
     * If you specify just the $timeout, the call will block until either the lock is acquired, or the timeout is
     * reached. This means you get a single block of time.
     *
     * If for whatever reason, you want to vary the way in which time is split within the $timeout interval, you can
     * do so via the $maxAttempts parameter. If greater than 1, this will split the timeout in a sensitive way for most
     * cases.
     *
     * Neither the $timeout, nor the $maxAttempts will be exceeded.
     *
     * Beware that, if $maxAttempts is > 1, you are not guaranteed to get the lock in the order in which you requested
     * it. This might be desirable, or not, depending on the circumstances.
     *

     * The way it works:
     * During the first second, attempt: 10 times every 10 milliseconds, 9 times every 100 milliseconds; total: 1s
     * During the first minute, attempt: 9 times every second. This amounts to 50 seconds left from the first minute,
     * because it includes the previous step of 1 second. The remaining 50 seconds are divided in 10 attempts of 5
     * seconds each.
     * The previous steps have covered the first minute. If more time is needed, proceed following the same pattern as
     * for minutes: 9 times every minute, and the remaining 50 minutes are attempted 10 times every 5 minutes.
     * The remaining time (if longer than 1h) is split in intervals of 10 minutes each.
     *
     * Examples (notation: s - second, m - minute, h - hour, ms - millisecond):
     * 1s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms
     * 2s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms + 1s
     * 3s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms + 1s + 1s
     * 10s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms + 9 x 1s
     * 11s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms + 10 x 1s
     * 16s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms + 9 x 1s + 1 x 5s
     * 59s => 10 x 10ms + 9 x 100ms + 8 x 1s + 10 x 5s
